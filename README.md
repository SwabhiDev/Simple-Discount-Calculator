# Simple-Discount-Calculator
I'm not really from CS/IT background and just recently started self learning Python. This is basically a simple program i made based on some suggestions by my brother. It's just a simple discount calculator which can calculate the discount value of any item as well as display its discounted value and total cost value after discount.
